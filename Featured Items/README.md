Feature select items on an index page.

This example demonstrates how to use two datasets on a page to split the items shown in the index into featured content and other content.

​

The Featured Items page shows the featured recipes in a gallery and other recipes in a table. The recipes collection contains a Boolean field named featured that we use to filter the two datasets. The featured recipes dataset is filtered to only contain items marked as featured in the collection. The other recipes dataset is filtered to only contain non-featured items. Featured recipes are shown in a gallery, while the other recipes are shown in a table. ​

​​

Clicking on a recipe in the gallery or table takes you to the dynamic item page for that recipe.

​​

The Recipes (Title) dynamic page shows a single recipe based on the published URL of the page. The dynamic page URL is set to select the recipe to display based on its title.
