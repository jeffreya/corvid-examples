# Preloader
### Display a preloader while content is loading
This example demonstrates how to create a preloader, which can be used to let users know website content is loading.

Some content can take a long time to loadâ€”for example, retrieving data from third-party services, databases, loading large amounts of data or data that involves complex processing.

Here we create a preloader using a box element. The preloader overlays the content elements. We simulate a slow load by using the JavaScript setTimeout function. When the content loads, the preloader is hidden using the FadeOut animation.
